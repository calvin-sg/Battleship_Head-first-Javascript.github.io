# Battleship game 
Proof of concept site: [battleship.calvin.sg](https://battleship.calvin.sg/)

This project uses MVC framework within its Javascript code, separating the logic and presentation layer behind Battleship web app into 3 logical components:

Model
- Contains game logic and data. 
- Keeps state of game, contains logic relates to state changes.

View: 
- Presents data to user and handles user interaction. 
- Keep display up to date with messages, hits and misses

Controller: 
- Interface between Model and View components.
- Keeps tracks of user's guess, progress, user input and brings to model

Self-directed learning on Head First JavaScript programming, 
with my own understanding illustrated in comprehensive notes/comments along the javascript code.

Media assets, Javascript, HTML, CSS codes are adapted from the physical book and website.
